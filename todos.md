# To-Do List

- Add finer information about managing the permissions to the user.
  Currently, the user is not informed about the permissions.
  After they've been prompted, the user may choose to decline.
  This isn't ideal, since we need geolocation permissions to work.

- Improve CSS rules for handling horizontal rotation in mobile devices
  Use media queries for this.

- Improve icons for mobile
  Currently there is a bunch of icons which do not center nicely on at least iOS
  I need to edit these using GIMP to make them a bit more centered.
  Also, Android is untested. (Android Studio?)

- Disable Zoom with touch app-wide

- Fix speed limit sign
